/*
 *  How to use this class
 *
 * This class simply reads an analogue input pin on an Arduino and calculates
 * the moving average across the defined number of samples.
 * 
 * This can be used to calculate the average of multiple analogue inputs by
 * instantiating multiple objects, however all will be averaged across the
 * same number of samples.
 * 
 * Include the class with:
 * 
 * #include "AnalogueAverage.h"
 * 
 * The default number of samples is 20, but this can be overridden at compile
 * time by using:
 * 
 * #define SAMPLES XX.
 * 
 * Instantiate each object with:
 * 
 * AnalogeAverage input(pin)
 * 
 * To ensure continued averaging, you must call the averageInput() function
 * continuously within your main loop() function:
 * 
 * void loop() {
 *   input.averageInput();
 *   ...
 * }
 * 
 * To obtain the current moving object, call the getAverage() function:
 * 
 * uint16_t movingAverage = input.getAverage();
